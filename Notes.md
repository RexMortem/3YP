# Logic Programming Languages

Concept of existential variables from Verse is interesting (seems to be the same as unification in Prolog) - constraining variables rather than giving an explicit value; could be similar to what I propose since I could give constraints/descriptions of the distribution and then have a sampling function.

- Assertion: fact-checking for specific properties from the distributions
- Could-Have/Extension of the project: graphical representation
- Distinction between "sampling" operations and "combining" operations

- LR parsing is more powerful (check power of LR vs LL)

Random stuff:
- Should probably check Rust style guide

Questions to ask:
- lots of type interactions - what about representing an absolute int as cL of 1

Progress Report:
- Biggest thing is that it proves that I understand my project very well; so expand on future of project thoroughly 
- lots of images/code
- Syntax and semantics that don't exist but are planning to be implemented
- markers for success: which algorithms to be able to write
