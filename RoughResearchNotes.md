Concept of existential variables from Verse is interesting (seems to be the same as unification in Prolog) - constraining variables rather than giving an explicit value; could be similar to what I propose since I could give constraints/descriptions of the distribution and then have a sampling function.

- Assertion: fact-checking for specific properties from the distributions
- Could-Have/Extension of the project: graphical representation
- Distinction between "sampling" operations and "combining" operations

- LR parsing is more powerful (check power of LR vs LL)
